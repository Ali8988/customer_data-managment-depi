customer data managment using azure



Project Overview


This project, titled Customer Data Management and Analysis, is focused on building a comprehensive data pipeline and predictive model to manage and analyze customer data effectively. Leveraging Microsoft Fabric and Azure services, the project integrates data management, predictive analytics, and the Medallion Architecture to provide a robust foundation for customer insights and decision-making.

Objectives


Data Management: Using Microsoft Fabric and Azure, the project involves organizing, cleaning, and managing customer-related data for ease of access and analysis. This includes consolidating data from multiple sources into Fabric's Lakehouse environment for a unified view.
Medallion Architecture Implementation: The project employs the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to create a structured data flow. Each layer adds incremental value to the data:
Bronze: Raw data ingestion from various sources.
Silver: Cleaned and transformed data for initial analytics.
Gold: Aggregated, ready-to-use data for advanced analytics and machine learning.
Predictive Modeling: Using the organized data, the project builds predictive models, such as customer churn prediction, to provide actionable insights. These models are created using Python and various machine learning libraries, with deployments facilitated by Azure services.
Technologies Used
Microsoft Fabric Online: For data lake storage, ETL processes, and dataset management.
Azure Services: For scalable, cloud-based analytics and machine learning model deployment.
Python: Used for data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive model building.
Medallion Architecture: Ensuring a streamlined, scalable data pipeline with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for continuous data improvement.
Key Features
Data Integration and Warehousing: Consolidates data from multiple sources to provide a complete view of customer interactions and transactions.
Predictive Analytics: Leverages machine learning models to predict customer behaviors, such as potential churn, enabling proactive decision-making.
Data Flow and Visualization: Provides visualizations for customer insights and performance tracking, using Fabric's visualization capabilities.
Project Structure


The project is organized into phases:

Data Ingestion and Storage: Raw data ingestion into the Bronze layer.
Data Transformation: Cleaning and transforming data for the Silver layer.
Data Aggregation and Modeling: Aggregating data in the Gold layer for analytics and predictive modeling.
Model Deployment: Deploying models via Azure for real-time and batch predictions.
